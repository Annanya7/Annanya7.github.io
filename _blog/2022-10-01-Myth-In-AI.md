## Let’s breakdown the most common myths about AI & Jobs
* AI will be deployed for repetitive tasks in say X industry. Does that imply the administrators would be unemployed? No, it simply means, they would be free to focus on more challenging tasks.

* The working population of say Y industry will actually witness the benefits of using AI as a tool augmenting their job.

* Employees of industry Z, might be displaced.
But hasn’t that been happening since time immemorial? Recall the industrial revolution of 1800s. Eventually, the cars put the horse and buggy out of business and mobile phones put the sound telegraph out of business.

### What will happen to people whose jobs are replaced by AI?
* They move on to other jobs. And that’s what is called the evolution of human race.
### Reality
* AI will change existing jobs and create new ones.
