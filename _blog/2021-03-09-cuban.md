Ironic as it sounds , Cuban Bracelets aren’t the natives of Cuba. They were produced in America. However due to the Mariel boatlift of 1980, the Cuban Population in the United States was immensely expanding at the same time. The Cuban immigrants found themselves blending in the vivid and loud colours of cultural hubs like New York and Miami. These Cuban links influenced a large part of Miami residents hence , they were also coined as Miami Chains. The charm of the Miami Cuban Link chain can be seen in every major city and urban areas especially such as Los Angeles and New York. This is “The Hip Hop Jewellery” which is a favourite among the music industry comprising various hip hop stars and rappers, and also among the flashy urban street thong. However this stylist choice of art remains to be a prominent choice at the other end of the globe regardless. Without a grain of doubt , this piece of unisexual jewellery is not just a trend , it’s a part of a long lasting tradition in the superior design and fashion industry.

Series of interlocking loops of metals wire (gold or platinum) is called a chain. Sometimes it varies in designs from balls or disc shaped intertwined loops to simple single chained.
